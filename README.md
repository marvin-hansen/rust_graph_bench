# Rust Graph Benchmark 

A very simple benchmark that tests the performance of various graphs written in Rust
especially for larger number of nodes added. Please note that, adding more than 25 millions nodes
may increase memory consumption so please check your Windows Task Manager / MacOS ActivityMonitor / Linux HTop
for memory usage. 

## Usage

1) Clone repo 
2) Cd rust_graph_bench
3) make run 

Alternatively, if you don't have make installed, use cargo run instead.
